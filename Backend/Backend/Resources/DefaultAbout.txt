This URL Shortener application allows users to convert long URLs into short, shareable links.

When a user submits a long URL, the backend generates a unique short identifier and stores the mapping in a database along with metadata like creation date and author. If the same URL already exists in the database, the existing short link is returned.

The shortened URL can then be used to redirect users to the original long URL. Each access to a short link is tracked, and additional information such as visit count or creation time can be retrieved via the API.
